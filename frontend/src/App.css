/* 
  All default CRA styles have been removed as the application
  now uses Material-UI for all core styling.
  This file can be used for truly global custom styles if needed in the future,
  but should be avoided for component-specific styling, which should leverage
  MUI's `sx` prop or styled-components approach.
